!mermaid
Use the ``<$mermaid>`` widget and place the mermaid commands within it. Any of the options that can be specified
in the ``.render()`` options variable can be specified as JSON-encoded values in attributes of the same name on the widgets.
The values of the attributes can also be the title of Data Tiddlers and the values will be used from the referenced Tiddler.
You can set the type of a Tiddler to text/vnd.tiddlywiki.mermaid and use the native commands directly in the Tiddler body. You can
add fields that are the names below prefixed with 'mermaid'. So "theme" becomes "mermaid-theme"

!!Notes
*JSON encoding only allows double-quotes ``"`` as string delimiters
*JSON encoding requires double-quotes around single string values
*The body of the text is parsed as a Tiddler. If you need conflicting elements, use either the ``text`` attribute on the widget or set the type field to ``text/vnd.tiddlywiki.mermaid`` and transclude the whole Tiddler
